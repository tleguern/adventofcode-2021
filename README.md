# Advent of Code 2021

This is my experiment in solving the Advent of Code chalenge using pure Ansible.

## Stats

Ansible can be very slow especially when abused for silly things.
This is a table of my solutions for each puzzle describing the execution time and the number of tasks executed with the status “ok”.

| Day/puzzle |  Time | Tasks |
|------------|-------|-------|
| 1/1        |  2m46 | 7750  |
| 1/2        |  9m36 | 17759 |
| 2/1        |  1m20 | 5001  |
| 2/2        |  1m37 | 5417  |
| 3/1        | 18m48 | 36056 |
